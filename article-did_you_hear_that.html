      <p class="lead">Let's talk about the System Shock 2 sounds.</p>
      <p>
        Trioptimum invites you for an adventurous journey. Engines started,
        ignition! But suddenly deep and hollow voices interfuse with the sounds
        of engines. Unhuman voices almost melodically speaking to us: "What is a
        drop of rain compared to the storm? What is a thought compared to the
        mind? Our unity is full of wonder which your tiny individualism can not
        even concieve..."

      />
      <p>
        What was that? Was that a voice of something higher, perhaps? Aliens or
        possibly the creator itself? We were waiting whole millennia for this
        day to come. A God... Suddenly a hurtling scream resonates down the
        hall. The cry travels through pipes. "I'M SORRY!" Calls the deep voice
        while leaning back so he could sweep and strike with his metal pipe.
      </p>
      <h3>The Many</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            The voice of the Many is muffeled but clear at the same time.
            Blending voices are bringing a dark cloud on the mind. But the
            content of the speech is gripping. They talk about deep thoughts
            which aren't to leave your mind so easily. The experience is by
            itself archetypal and also very frighting.
          </p>
          <h3>Shodan</h3>
          <p>
            "I am Shodan..." resonates electric words through the spaceship. A
            voice of the spaceship computer which has lost her mind. Her voice
            is somewhat peculiar. It's discontinous but at the same time it's
            unflency is created to fill the player with magnificence of the
            crazy ruler on Tau Cety 5.

      <h3>Xerxes</h3>
      <p>
        Xerxes is a security system aboard. His voice is in contrast clear and
        calm. His funcion is largely informative. The player listens and pays
        attention on the content of Xerxes' words. By the time when the player
        is sinking to the atmosphere of the game, Xerxes suddenly delivers a
        sentece without an informative character: "Glory to
        the flesh, glory to the mass." he says with his cold voice. This sentece is a prove of Xerxes'
        poisoning by the ideology of the Many.
